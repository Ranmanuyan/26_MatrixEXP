% norm_c is a code written in C language. 
% norm_c(X,1) returns the 1-norm of X.
% norm_c(X,'inf') returns the infinity norm of X.
% norm_c(X,'fro') returns the Frobenisu norm of X.
% X must be a sparse matrix.
% According to the numerical examples, norm_c is more efficient than the 
% built-in function "norm" in Matlab when evaluating the F-norm and inf-norm. 
% For the 1-norm, both codes require similar execution time.
